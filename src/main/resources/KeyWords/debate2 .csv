160,"Clinton","And we need to be very clear about that.","9/26/16"
161,"Trump","So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do. But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. But we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.","9/26/16"
162,"Holt","Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race. The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.","9/26/16"
163,"Clinton","Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.","9/26/16"
164,"Clinton","Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.","9/26/16"
165,"Holt","All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?","9/26/16"
166,"Trump","Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country. And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country. I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.","9/26/16"
167,"Holt","Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.","9/26/16"
168,"Trump","No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.","9/26/16"
169,"Holt","The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.","9/26/16"
170,"Trump","No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago. But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.","9/26/16"
171,"Trump","You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good. But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.","9/26/16"
172,"Holt","Secretary Clinton...","9/26/16"
173,"Trump","But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.","9/26/16"
174,"Holt","Secretary Clinton?","9/26/16"
175,"Clinton","Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.","9/26/16"
176,"Trump","Ugh.","9/26/16"
177,"Clinton","You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.","9/26/16"
178,"Holt","Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?","9/26/16"
179,"Clinton","Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.","9/26/16"
180,"Clinton","They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.","9/26/16"
181,"Holt","Mr. Trump...","9/26/16"
182,"Trump","I'd like to respond to that.","9/26/16"
183,"Holt","Please.","9/26/16"
184,"Trump","First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.","9/26/16"
185,"Clinton","Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...","9/26/16"
186,"Trump","No, you're wrong. You're wrong.","9/26/16"
187,"Clinton","No, I'm not.","9/26/16"
188,"Trump","Murders are up. All right. You check it.","9/26/16"
189,"Clinton","New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.","9/26/16"
190,"Holt","This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...","9/26/16"
191,"Trump","I'd like to just respond, if I might.","9/26/16"
192,"Holt","Please -- 20 seconds.","9/26/16"
193,"Trump","I'd just like to respond.","9/26/16"
194,"Holt","Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.","9/26/16"
195,"Trump","I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years. The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.","9/26/16"
196,"Holt","Mr. Trump, let me...","9/26/16"
197,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","9/26/16"
198,"Clinton","Well, I -- I do think...","9/26/16"
199,"Trump","And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.","9/26/16"
200,"Holt","Mr. Trump, I...","9/26/16"
201,"Clinton","I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.","9/26/16"
202,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","9/26/16"
203,"Holt","Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?","9/26/16"
204,"Trump","I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.","9/26/16"
205,"Trump","And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.","9/26/16"
206,"Holt","That was...","9/26/16"
207,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","9/26/16"
208,"Trump","Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.","9/26/16"
209,"Holt","I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...","9/26/16"
210,"Trump","Yeah.","9/26/16"
211,"Holt",".... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?","9/26/16"
212,"Trump","Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.","9/26/16"
213,"Holt","I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...","9/26/16"
214,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","9/26/16"
215,"Trump","Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing. But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that. And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.","9/26/16"
216,"Holt","Secretary Clinton?","9/26/16"
217,"Clinton","Well, just listen to what you heard.","9/26/16"
218,"Audience","(LAUGHTER)","9/26/16"
219,"Clinton","And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.","9/26/16"
220,"Holt","Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.","9/26/16"
221,"Trump","I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.","9/26/16"
222,"Trump","I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things. I'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.","9/26/16"
223,"Holt","Our next segment is called ""Securing America."" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it? Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.","9/26/16"
224,"Clinton","Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money. But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...","9/26/16"
225,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","9/26/16"
226,"Clinton","... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information. And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country. And the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...","9/26/16"
227,"Holt","Your two minutes have expired.","9/26/16"
228,"Clinton","... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.","9/26/16"
229,"Holt","Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?","9/26/16"
230,"Trump","I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents. So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?","9/26/16"
231,"Trump","You don't know who broke in to DNC. But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.","9/26/16"
232,"Holt","Secretary Clinton?","9/26/16"
233,"Clinton","Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate. We're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.","9/26/16"
234,"Holt","You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?","9/26/16"
235,"Trump","Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. ""We will take out ISIS."" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them. Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.","9/26/16"
236,"Holt","Secretary Clinton?","9/26/16"
237,"Clinton","Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.","9/26/16"
238,"Trump","Wrong.","9/26/16"
239,"Clinton","That is absolutely proved over and over again.","9/26/16"
240,"Trump","Wrong. Wrong.","9/26/16"
241,"Clinton","He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.","9/26/16"
242,"Clinton","But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that. But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of. We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. They're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.","9/26/16"
243,"Holt","Mr. Trump...","9/26/16"
244,"Trump","Well, I have to respond.","9/26/16"
245,"Holt","Please respond.","9/26/16"
246,"Trump","The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said...","9/26/16"
247,"Clinton","Lester, we've covered...","9/26/16"
248,"Trump","No, wait a minute.","9/26/16"
249,"Clinton","We've covered this ground.","9/26/16"
250,"Trump","When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so.","9/26/16"
251,"Holt","Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...","9/26/16"
252,"Trump","I did not support the war in Iraq.","9/26/16"
253,"Holt","In 2002...","9/26/16"
254,"Trump","That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.","9/26/16"
255,"Holt","My question is, since you supported it...","9/26/16"
256,"Trump","Just -- would you like to hear...","9/26/16"
257,"Holt","... why is your -- why is your judgment...","9/26/16"
258,"Trump","Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.","9/26/16"
259,"Holt","The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...","9/26/16"
260,"Trump","The record does not show that.","9/26/16"
261,"Holt","Why was -- is your judgment any...","9/26/16"
262,"Trump","The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.","9/26/16"
263,"Holt","Why is your judgment better than...","9/26/16"
264,"Trump","And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war. And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq. And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster.","9/26/16"
265,"Holt","My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...","9/26/16"
266,"Trump","No, no. You didn't hear what I said.","9/26/16"
267,"Holt","Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?","9/26/16"
268,"Trump","Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?","9/26/16"
269,"Audience","(LAUGHTER)","9/26/16"
270,"Trump","I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...","9/26/16"
271,"Holt","Secretary Clinton?","9/26/16"
272,"Trump","Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.","9/26/16"
273,"Holt","Secretary Clinton?","9/26/16"
274,"Clinton","Whew, OK.","9/26/16"
275,"Audience","(LAUGHTER)","9/26/16"
276,"Clinton","Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations. The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.","9/26/16"
277,"Trump","That would not start a war.","9/26/16"
278,"Clinton","That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...","9/26/16"
279,"Trump","No, they were taunting us.","9/26/16"
280,"Clinton","... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...","9/26/16"
281,"Trump","Wrong.","9/26/16"
282,"Clinton","... have a good time, folks.","9/26/16"
283,"Trump","It's lies.","9/26/16"
284,"Clinton","And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.","9/26/16"
285,"Trump","That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...","9/26/16"
286,"Clinton","It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem.","9/26/16"
287,"Audience","(LAUGHTER)","9/26/16"
288,"Trump","It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks. Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...","9/26/16"
289,"Holt","We need to move on.","9/26/16"
290,"Trump","Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.","9/26/16"
291,"Holt","Our last...","9/26/16"
292,"Trump","As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.","9/26/16"
293,"Holt","Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.","9/26/16"
294,"Trump","Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.","9/26/16"
295,"Holt","Your two minutes is expired.","9/26/16"
296,"Trump","And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.","9/26/16"
297,"Holt","All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.","9/26/16"
298,"Clinton","Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good. It's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home. We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...","9/26/16"
299,"Holt","Your two minutes is...","9/26/16"
300,"Clinton","... to be given any opportunities at all.","9/26/16"
301,"Holt","... is expired.","9/26/16"
302,"Trump","Lester, one thing I'd like to say.","9/26/16"
303,"Holt","Very quickly. Twenty seconds.","9/26/16"
304,"Trump","I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.","9/26/16"
305,"Holt","Mr. Trump...","9/26/16"
306,"Trump","And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world...","9/26/16"
307,"Holt","We have just...","9/26/16"
308,"Trump","... where they're not paying us what we need.","9/26/16"
309,"Holt","We have just a few final questions...","9/26/16"
310,"Trump","And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.","9/26/16"
311,"Holt","Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look."" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that?","9/26/16"
312,"Trump","She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.","9/26/16"
313,"Holt","The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look.""","9/26/16"
314,"Trump","You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question? You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.","9/26/16"
315,"Holt","Let's let her respond.","9/26/16"
316,"Clinton","Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.","9/26/16"
317,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","9/26/16"
318,"Trump","The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.","9/26/16"
319,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","9/26/16"
320,"Trump","But it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.","9/26/16"
321,"Holt","We are at -- we are at the final question.","9/26/16"
322,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","9/26/16"
323,"Clinton","Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.","9/26/16"
324,"Holt","Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.","9/26/16"
325,"Clinton","You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...","9/26/16"
326,"Trump","I never said that.","9/26/16"
327,"Clinton",".... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.","9/26/16"
328,"Trump","I didn't say that.","9/26/16"
329,"Clinton","And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."" Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.","9/26/16"
330,"Trump","Where did you find this? Where did you find this?","9/26/16"
331,"Clinton","Her name is Alicia Machado.","9/26/16"
332,"Trump","Where did you find this?","9/26/16"
333,"Clinton","And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...","9/26/16"
334,"Trump","Oh, really?","9/26/16"
335,"Clinton","... she's going to vote this November.","9/26/16"
336,"Trump","OK, good. Let me just tell you...","9/26/16"
337,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","9/26/16"
338,"Holt","Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...","9/26/16"
339,"Trump","You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...","9/26/16"
340,"Holt","Please very quickly.","9/26/16"
341,"Trump","... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that. But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...","9/26/16"
342,"Holt","We have to move on to the final question.","9/26/16"
343,"Trump","... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.","9/26/16"
344,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","9/26/16"
345,"Holt","One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?","9/26/16"
346,"Clinton","Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election. And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.","9/26/16"
347,"Holt","Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP:","9/26/16"
348,"Trump","The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.","9/26/16"
349,"Holt","Will you accept the outcome of the election?","9/26/16"
350,"Trump","Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.","9/26/16"
351,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","9/26/16"
352,"Holt","All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would. The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue. A reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight. Good night, everyone.","9/26/16"
1,"Quijano","Good evening. From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News. It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence. Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines. The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.","10/4/16"
2,"Quijano","We have an enthusiastic audience tonight. They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine. (","10/4/16"
3,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","10/4/16"
4,"Quijano","Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight. I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership. Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world. What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice? Senator Kaine?","10/4/16"
5,"Kaine","Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate. Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results. And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You've been a city councilman and mayor. You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives. And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I'm so proud of her.","10/4/16"
6,"Kaine","I'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life. We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.","10/4/16"
7,"Quijano","Governor Pence?","10/4/16"
8,"Pence","Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates. It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened. We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.","10/4/16"
9,"Pence","I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age. My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and -- and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience.","10/4/16"
10,"Quijano","Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?","10/4/16"
11,"Kaine","Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant. Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first. And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, ""off the backs of the little guy."" And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish ""me first"" style of Donald Trump.","10/4/16"
12,"Quijano","Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, ""thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."" Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president. Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?","10/4/16"
13,"Pence","Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign. It really is remarkable. At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create. The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...","10/4/16"
14,"Kaine","You guys love Russia. You both have said...","10/4/16"
15,"Pence","... their heavy-handed approach.","10/4/16"
16,"Kaine","You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.","10/4/16"
17,"Pence","Well...","10/4/16"
18,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
19,"Quijano","Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment. But I do want to get back to the question at...","10/4/16"
20,"Pence","But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, I'll...","10/4/16"
21,"Kaine","These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader. How can that...","10/4/16"
22,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
23,"Quijano","Yes, and we will get to that, Senator. We do have that coming up here. But in the meantime, the questions...","10/4/16"
24,"Pence","Well, Senator, I must have hit a...","10/4/16"
25,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
26,"Pence","I must have hit a nerve here.","10/4/16"
27,"Quijano","Why the disconnect?","10/4/16"
28,"Pence","Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults. Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. He's brought an extraordinary business acumen. He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.","10/4/16"
29,"Kaine","And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.","10/4/16"
30,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
31,"Quijano","And why the disconnect with your running mate?","10/4/16"
32,"Pence","But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. And that's because they're paying attention. I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on. She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.","10/4/16"
33,"Kaine","You are Donald Trump's apprentice. Let me talk about this...","10/4/16"
34,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
35,"Pence","Senator, I think I'm still on my time.","10/4/16"
36,"Kaine","Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?","10/4/16"
37,"Quijano","This is our open discussion.","10/4/16"
38,"Kaine","Yeah, let's talk about the state of...","10/4/16"
39,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
40,"Pence","Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can.","10/4/16"
41,"Kaine","Finish your sentence.","10/4/16"
42,"Pence","The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.","10/4/16"
43,"Kaine","OK, now I can weigh in. Now...","10/4/16"
44,"Pence","She had a private server...","10/4/16"
45,"Kaine","Now, I get to weigh in. Now, let me just say this...","10/4/16"
46,"Pence","... that was discovered...","10/4/16"
47,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
48,"Quijano","... Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.","10/4/16"
49,"Pence","... keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.","10/4/16"
50,"Kaine","Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault.","10/4/16"
51,"Pence","Do you?","10/4/16"
52,"Kaine","Let me tell you this. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?","10/4/16"
53,"Pence","Yes.","10/4/16"
54,"Kaine","Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan? Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile? Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth. She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile. She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.","10/4/16"
55,"Pence","Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?","10/4/16"
56,"Kaine","Absolutely, without firing a shot. And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.","10/4/16"
57,"Pence","Right and...","10/4/16"
58,"Kaine","These are very, very good things.","10/4/16"
59,"Pence","And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...","10/4/16"
60,"Kaine","Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.","10/4/16"
61,"Pence","Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...","10/4/16"
62,"Kaine","No, that is incorrect. That's incorrect.","10/4/16"
63,"Pence","And so we removed -- we removed all of our...","10/4/16"
64,"Quijano","Gentlemen, we'll get to...","10/4/16"
65,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
66,"Pence","... troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum.","10/4/16"
67,"Kaine","But I'd like to correct...","10/4/16"
68,"Pence","... and overrun vast areas of Iraq.","10/4/16"
69,"Kaine","Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011. And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops. And guess what? If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.","10/4/16"
70,"Pence","It was a failure of the secretary of state...","10/4/16"
71,"Quijano","We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen.","10/4/16"
72,"Kaine","If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's...","10/4/16"
73,"Quijano","There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy. Let's turn to the issue of the economy.","10/4/16"
74,"Kaine","OK.","10/4/16"
75,"Quijano","According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it. Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence?","10/4/16"
76,"Pence","I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.","10/4/16"
77,"Pence","But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.","10/4/16"
78,"Quijano","Senator Kaine?","10/4/16"
79,"Kaine","Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump? I think that's not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a ""you're hired"" plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.","10/4/16"
80,"Kaine","The Trump plan is a different plan. It's a ""you're fired"" plan. And there's two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump -- why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.","10/4/16"
81,"Quijano","On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years. Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. Does that seem fair to you?","10/4/16"
82,"Pence","Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines. Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We're in the...","10/4/16"
83,"Kaine","Fifteen million new jobs?","10/4/16"
84,"Pence","... slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.","10/4/16"
85,"Kaine","Fifteen million new jobs?","10/4/16"
86,"Quijano","Governor...","10/4/16"
87,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
88,"Pence","There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side...","10/4/16"
89,"Kaine","And the poverty level and the median income...","10/4/16"
90,"Pence","... stepped into the Oval Office.","10/4/16"
91,"Kaine","... improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.","10/4/16"
92,"Pence","You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes.","10/4/16"
93,"Kaine","But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.","10/4/16"
94,"Pence","It's not more spending...","10/4/16"
95,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
96,"Kaine","I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.","10/4/16"
97,"Pence","Absolutely I will.","10/4/16"
98,"Quijano","Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.","10/4/16"
99,"Pence","Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business. Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.","10/4/16"
100,"Kaine","But why won't he release his tax returns?","10/4/16"
101,"Pence","Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he...","10/4/16"
102,"Kaine","I do want to come back to that, but...","10/4/16"
103,"Pence","His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly.","10/4/16"
104,"Kaine","How do you know that? You haven't seen his tax returns.","10/4/16"
105,"Pence","He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.","10/4/16"
106,"Kaine","How do you know that?","10/4/16"
107,"Pence","And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes...","10/4/16"
108,"Kaine","Elaine, let me talk about something.","10/4/16"
109,"Quijano","Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.","10/4/16"
110,"Kaine","OK.","10/4/16"
111,"Pence","The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.","10/4/16"
112,"Kaine","Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, ""If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes."" He's broken his first...","10/4/16"
113,"Pence","And he will.","10/4/16"
114,"Kaine","He's broken his first promise. Second, he stood on the stage...","10/4/16"
115,"Pence","He hasn't broken his promise. He said he's...","10/4/16"
116,"Kaine","He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, ""That makes me smart."" So it's smart not to pay for our military? It's smart not to pay for veterans? It's smart not to pay for teachers? And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid. And the last thing I'll say is this...","10/4/16"
117,"Pence","Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?","10/4/16"
118,"Kaine","The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is...","10/4/16"
119,"Pence","I do.","10/4/16"
120,"Kaine","Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president. And he's breaking his promise.","10/4/16"
121,"Pence","Elaine, I have to respond to this.","10/4/16"
122,"Quijano","You get very little time, 20 seconds.","10/4/16"
123,"Pence","I'll be -- I'll be very respectful.","10/4/16"
124,"Quijano","Governor?","10/4/16"
125,"Pence","Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.","10/4/16"
126,"Kaine","But he said he would release his tax returns.","10/4/16"
127,"Quijano","All right, Gentlemen...","10/4/16"
128,"Pence","The American people can review that. And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over...","10/4/16"
129,"Quijano","... I need to ask you about Social Security...","10/4/16"
130,"Kaine","Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.","10/4/16"
131,"Pence","They're going to raise your taxes. We're going to cut your taxes.","10/4/16"
132,"Quijano","Gentlemen...","10/4/16"
133,"Kaine","If you can't meet Nixon's standard...","10/4/16"
134,"Quijano","The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other. I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.","10/4/16"
135,"Kaine","All right. We're having fun up here.","10/4/16"
136,"Quijano","Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut?","10/4/16"
137,"Kaine","First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done. It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty. And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty. We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that. Here's what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us. And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security. And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.","10/4/16"
138,"Quijano","Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond.","10/4/16"
139,"Pence","Well, thanks, Elaine. There they go again. OK...","10/4/16"
140,"Kaine","Go read -- go read the book.","10/4/16"
141,"Pence","All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it.","10/4/16"
142,"Kaine","Go read the book.","10/4/16"
143,"Pence","We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare. That's what this campaign is really about, Senator. And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out...","10/4/16"
144,"Kaine","But -- but you have a voting record, Governor.","10/4/16"
145,"Pence","And I get all of that. I just, look...","10/4/16"
146,"Kaine","I...","10/4/16"
147,"Pence","There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.","10/4/16"
148,"Kaine","I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record.","10/4/16"
149,"Pence","I have to go back to.","10/4/16"
150,"Quijano","We...","10/4/16"
151,"Pence","Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security. Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes. We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to...","10/4/16"
152,"Kaine","You're not going to cut taxes. You're going to raise taxes on the middle class.","10/4/16"
153,"Pence","... reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.","10/4/16"
154,"Quijano","All right.","10/4/16"
155,"Pence","Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a -- in a mountain range of debt. And we're going to face hard choices and...","10/4/16"
156,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
157,"Quijano","Gentleman, I want to move on now.","10/4/16"
158,"Kaine","You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.","10/4/16"
159,"Quijano","All right. Let me move on now...","10/4/16"
160,"Pence","Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy.","10/4/16"
161,"Quijano","... to the issue of law enforcement and race relations. Law enforcement and race relations. After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, ""We're asking cops to do too much in this country. Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops."" Do we ask too much of police officers in this country? And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns? Senator Kaine?","10/4/16"
162,"Kaine","Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment. I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here's what we'll do. We'll focus on community policing. We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I'm a gun-owner. I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.","10/4/16"
163,"Quijano","Governor Pence?","10/4/16"
164,"Pence","You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It's worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order. But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop. I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn. We -- we grieve with those who grieve. And we're saddened at the loss of life. But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States. I just think...","10/4/16"
165,"Kaine","Can I -- can I explain...","10/4/16"
166,"Pence","... I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy. We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action. But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.","10/4/16"
167,"Kaine","Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement. And if you're afraid to have...","10/4/16"
168,"Pence","I'm not afraid to bring that up.","10/4/16"
169,"Kaine","And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it. And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking. We would agree this was a heartbreaking example. The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school. And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated. But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked. The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.","10/4/16"
170,"Pence","We need criminal justice reform.","10/4/16"
171,"Kaine","Well, we do.","10/4/16"
172,"Pence","Indiana has passed criminal justice reform.","10/4/16"
173,"Kaine","But I just want to say, those who say that we should not...","10/4/16"
174,"Pence","But that's not what you're talking about.","10/4/16"
175,"Kaine","... we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem...","10/4/16"
176,"Quijano","Governor Pence...","10/4/16"
177,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
178,"Quijano","Governor Pence...","10/4/16"
179,"Pence","Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?","10/4/16"
180,"Kaine","Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even...","10/4/16"
181,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
182,"Quijano","Governor Pence, I have a question on that point.","10/4/16"
183,"Pence","I did not make that statement. I...","10/4/16"
184,"Quijano","Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor. He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year.","10/4/16"
185,"Kaine","A U.S. senator.","10/4/16"
186,"Quijano","He said, ""I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself."" What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences?","10/4/16"
187,"Pence","Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend. And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally. I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it. I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act. We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice. But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement. We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...","10/4/16"
188,"Kaine","Elaine, can I...","10/4/16"
189,"Quijano","So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor?","10/4/16"
190,"Pence","Law enforcement in this country is a force for good. They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day. But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement. You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk. Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime...","10/4/16"
191,"Kaine","Elaine, let me -- let me...","10/4/16"
192,"Quijano","Governor, the question is about Senator Scott. What would -- what would you tell Senator Scott?","10/4/16"
193,"Kaine","Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in. I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea. And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law. So there is a fundamental respect issue here. And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top. Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured. He said African-Americans are living in Hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen. If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about. And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.","10/4/16"
194,"Quijano","All right. I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration. Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported. What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes? Governor Pence?","10/4/16"
195,"Pence","Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We've been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak. But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country. And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain. But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago.","10/4/16"
196,"Kaine","These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor.","10/4/16"
197,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
198,"Pence","It's my time, Senator.","10/4/16"
199,"Quijano","It is, in fact, the governor's time.","10/4/16"
200,"Kaine","I apologize. It's your two minutes. I apologize.","10/4/16"
201,"Pence","Thanks. I forgive you. He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign? I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American. I mean, it's extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another ""ism"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean...","10/4/16"
202,"Quijano","Governor...","10/4/16"
203,"Pence","That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton...","10/4/16"
204,"Quijano","Senator Kaine?","10/4/16"
205,"Pence",".... calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.","10/4/16"
206,"Kaine","Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that.","10/4/16"
207,"Pence","She said she shouldn't have said half.","10/4/16"
208,"Quijano","Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please.","10/4/16"
209,"Kaine","Yeah, that's right, so now we're even.","10/4/16"
210,"Pence","Yeah.","10/4/16"
211,"Audience","(LAUGHTER)","10/4/16"
212,"Kaine","Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero...","10/4/16"
213,"Pence","Oh...","10/4/16"
214,"Kaine","... to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.","10/4/16"
215,"Pence","She apologized for saying ""half.""","10/4/16"
216,"Quijano","Governor. It is his two minutes, please.","10/4/16"
217,"Kaine","Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight? Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell? Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States? You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing. Immigration. There's two plans on the table. Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You've got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks. That's our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that. That's another 4.5 million people. These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people. And I cannot believe...","10/4/16"
218,"Pence","That's nonsense. That's nonsense.","10/4/16"
219,"Kaine","I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone.","10/4/16"
220,"Pence","Senator, we have a deportation force. It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.","10/4/16"
221,"Kaine","So you like the 16 million deportations?","10/4/16"
222,"Pence","Senator, that's -- that's nonsense. Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty. That's...","10/4/16"
223,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
224,"Kaine","Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986.","10/4/16"
225,"Pence","They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill. We all know the routine. It's amnesty. And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.","10/4/16"
226,"Pence","That's how Washington always plays it.","10/4/16"
227,"Kaine","No, I...","10/4/16"
228,"Pence","They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border... (","10/4/16"
229,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
230,"Kaine","... border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.","10/4/16"
231,"Quijano","Governor, Mr. Trump has said...","10/4/16"
232,"Pence","Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation. Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.","10/4/16"
233,"Quijano","So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave? Would they be forcibly removed?","10/4/16"
234,"Pence","Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security. It begins with border security. And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement. But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens. We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement. We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities. The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity. And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically. Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas. We're going to enforce the law of this country. We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that. And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have...","10/4/16"
235,"Kaine","I just have to correct Governor Pence....","10/4/16"
236,"Pence","... where people can come into this country.","10/4/16"
237,"Kaine","I have to...","10/4/16"
238,"Pence","That's the order that you should do it. Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system.","10/4/16"
239,"Kaine","I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in. But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said. When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody. He said, quote, ""They will all be gone."" ""They will all be gone."" And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said. And to add...","10/4/16"
240,"Pence","He's talking about criminal aliens.","10/4/16"
241,"Kaine","And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants. Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families. Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger. When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that.","10/4/16"
242,"Quijano","Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism. Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago? Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased? Senator Kaine?","10/4/16"
243,"Kaine","The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead. The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There's only 15,000. But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And she's got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here's her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it. Donald Trump. Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn't have a plan. He said, ""I have a secret plan,"" and then he said, ""Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL."" And then he said, ""I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan."" And finally he said, ""I'm going to fire all the generals."" He doesn't have a plan. But he does have dangerous ideas. Here's four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay ""big league."" Third, he loves dictators. He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...","10/4/16"
244,"Pence","Oh, please. Come on.","10/4/16"
245,"Kaine","... and Saddam Hussein. And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons. He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them. And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: ""Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves."" I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.","10/4/16"
246,"Quijano","Governor Pence?","10/4/16"
247,"Pence","Did you work on that one a long time? Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.","10/4/16"
248,"Kaine","Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it.","10/4/16"
249,"Pence","Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. It's absolutely inarguable. We've weakened America's place in the world. It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership. I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11. I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.","10/4/16"
250,"Kaine","I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's...","10/4/16"
251,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
252,"Pence","I know you were. We all lived through that day as a nation. It was heartbreaking. And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice. But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida. Our primary threat today is ISIS. And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009. But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow. And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.","10/4/16"
253,"Kaine","Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?","10/4/16"
254,"Pence","You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program.","10/4/16"
255,"Kaine","Yes, we did.","10/4/16"
256,"Pence","You essentially...","10/4/16"
257,"Kaine","Even the Israeli military says it stopped.","10/4/16"
258,"Pence","... guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off.","10/4/16"
259,"Quijano","Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism. But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents. What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?","10/4/16"
260,"Pence","Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first. I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life. But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500... (","10/4/16"

262,"Kaine","Elaine, I want to...","10/4/16"
263,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
264,"Quijano","Governor, the question was about homegrown.","10/4/16"
265,"Pence","Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program...","10/4/16"
266,"Kaine","Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous.","10/4/16"
267,"Pence","That's not -- that's absolutely false.","10/4/16"
268,"Kaine","That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine.","10/4/16"
269,"Pence","The Seventh Circuit...","10/4/16"
270,"Kaine","We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration. Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous? These guys say all Mexicans are bad.","10/4/16"
271,"Pence","That's absolutely false.","10/4/16"
272,"Kaine","And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim. Mike Pence...","10/4/16"
273,"Pence","Absolutely...","10/4/16"
274,"Kaine","... put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...","10/4/16"
275,"Pence","Right. Right.","10/4/16"
276,"Kaine","... and said it was discriminatory...","10/4/16"
277,"Pence","And those judges -- those judges said...","10/4/16"
278,"Kaine","We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination.","10/4/16"
279,"Quijano","Governor?","10/4/16"
280,"Pence","Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States. Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS.","10/4/16"
281,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
282,"Kaine","But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.","10/4/16"
283,"Pence","But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game. I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state.","10/4/16"
284,"Kaine","But, Governor Pence...","10/4/16"
285,"Pence","So you bet I suspended that program.","10/4/16"
286,"Kaine","But, Governor Pence, I just...","10/4/16"
287,"Pence","And I stand by that decision. And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.","10/4/16"
288,"Kaine","Sure. Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not. We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.","10/4/16"
289,"Pence","But the problem with that...","10/4/16"
290,"Kaine","That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of...","10/4/16"
291,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
292,"Pence","Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.","10/4/16"
293,"Kaine","Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in.","10/4/16"

295,"Kaine","When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in.","10/4/16"
296,"Pence","The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain. You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator. I understand the...","10/4/16"
297,"Kaine","By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?","10/4/16"
298,"Pence","... the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program...","10/4/16"
299,"Quijano","Senator Kaine, let me ask you this. Secretary Clinton...","10/4/16"
300,"Pence","We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.","10/4/16"
301,"Quijano","... has talked about an intelligence surge.","10/4/16"
302,"Kaine","Yes.","10/4/16"
303,"Quijano","What exactly would an intelligence surge look like? And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?","10/4/16"
304,"Kaine","Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine. It's two things. It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies. So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence. But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next. Alliances are critical. That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.","10/4/16"
305,"Pence","That's not his plan.","10/4/16"
306,"Kaine","Well, he said NATO is obsolete. And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with? Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances. She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. And that's what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.","10/4/16"
307,"Quijano","All right. I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand...","10/4/16"
308,"Pence","Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?","10/4/16"
309,"Quijano","You can -- you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.","10/4/16"
310,"Pence","First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.","10/4/16"
311,"Kaine","We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.","10/4/16"
312,"Pence","We have an intelligence, sir (ph). But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it...","10/4/16"
313,"Quijano","And I don't -- 30 seconds is on up.","10/4/16"
314,"Pence","... about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.","10/4/16"
315,"Quijano","Right.","10/4/16"
316,"Pence","Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign...","10/4/16"

321,"Kaine","And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that... (","10/4/16"
322,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"
323,"Quijano","All right, we are moving on now. Two hundred fifty thousand people...","10/4/16"
324,"Pence","If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did...","10/4/16"
325,"Quijano","... one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor...","10/4/16"
326,"Pence","... they'd be court martialed.","10/4/16"
327,"Kaine","That is absolutely false and you know that.","10/4/16"
328,"Pence","Absolutely true.","10/4/16"
329,"Kaine","And you know that, Governor.","10/4/16"
330,"Quijano","Governor...","10/4/16"
331,"Pence","It's absolutely true.","10/4/16"
332,"Quijano","Gentlemen, please.","10/4/16"
333,"Kaine","Because the FBI did an investigation.","10/4/16"
334,"Quijano","Gentlemen.","10/4/16"
335,"Kaine","And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry.","10/4/16"
336,"Quijano","Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.","10/4/16"
337,"Kaine","Syria.","10/4/16"
338,"Quijano","I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?","10/4/16"
339,"Pence","The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.","10/4/16"
340,"Quijano","Governor, your two minutes are up.","10/4/16"
341,"Pence","We've just got to have American strength on the world stage. When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president.","10/4/16"
342,"Quijano","Senator Kaine?","10/4/16"
343,"Kaine","Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea. And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin. The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class. I'll tell you what offends me...","10/4/16"
344,"Pence","Well, that offended me.","10/4/16"
345,"Kaine","Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military. No, he won't. Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes. The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995. Those years included the years of 9/11. So get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism. Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight. It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror.","10/4/16"
346,"Quijano","The question was about Aleppo, Senator.","10/4/16"
347,"Kaine","He wouldn't support troops. He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine. When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important.","10/4/16"
348,"Quijano","Right.","10/4/16"
349,"Kaine","And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria. It's very important.","10/4/16"
350,"Quijano","Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone. Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically? How would you keep it safe?","10/4/16"
351,"Pence","Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops. Donald Trump supports our veterans.","10/4/16"
352,"Kaine","He won't pay taxes.","10/4/16"
353,"Pence","Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions? How does that work?","10/4/16"
354,"Quijano","Gentlemen, this is about Syria. I'd like to...","10/4/16"
355,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/4/16"

357,"Kaine","It is about our troops. It is about our troops.","10/4/16"
358,"Pence","I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject.","10/4/16"
359,"Kaine","How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?","10/4/16"
360,"Pence","I understand why you want to change the subject. And let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here...","10/4/16"
361,"Kaine","Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?","10/4/16"
1,"Raddatz","Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.","10/9/16"
2,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","10/9/16"
3,"Cooper","Thank you very much for being here. We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?","10/9/16"
4,"QUESTION","Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth? ","10/9/16"
5,"Clinton","Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else. If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do. So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve. ","10/9/16"
6,"Cooper","Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. ","10/9/16"
7,"Trump","Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. ","10/9/16"
8,"Trump","And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It's hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say who's making these deals? We're going the make great deals. We're going to have a strong border. We're going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It's called make America great again. ","10/9/16"
9,"Cooper","Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that? ","10/9/16"
10,"Trump","No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk. You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what's going on. Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We're going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS. ","10/9/16"
11,"Cooper","So, Mr. Trump... ","10/9/16"
12,"Trump","And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.","10/9/16"
13,"Cooper","Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent? ","10/9/16"
14,"Trump","I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.","10/9/16"
15,"Cooper","So, for the record, you're saying you never did that? ","10/9/16"
16,"Trump","I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women. ","10/9/16"
17,"Cooper","Have you ever done those things?","10/9/16"
18,"Trump","And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe. We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now. People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places. We're going to make America safe again. We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again. And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation. ","10/9/16"
19,"Cooper","Thank you, Mr. Trump. ","10/9/16"
20,"Trump","Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth. ","10/9/16"
21,"Cooper","Thank you, Mr. Trump. ","10/9/16"
22,"Trump","And that's what I want to talk about.","10/9/16"
23,"Cooper","Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond? ","10/9/16"
24,"Clinton","Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is. But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we've seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms. So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. ","10/9/16"
25,"Clinton","These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president. ","10/9/16"
26,"Raddatz","And we want to get to some questions from online...","10/9/16"
27,"Trump","Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.","10/9/16"
28,"Raddatz","Yes, you can respond to that. ","10/9/16"
29,"Trump","It's just words, folks. It's just words. Those words, I've been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed. I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I'm going to help the African-Americans. I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities. She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign... ","10/9/16"
30,"Raddatz","Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions. ","10/9/16"
31,"Trump","So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond? ","10/9/16"
32,"Raddatz","You're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.","10/9/16"
33,"Trump","Sounds fair.","10/9/16"
34,"Raddatz","This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, ""Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?"" So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this. ","10/9/16"
35,"Trump","It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I'm not proud of it. But that was something that happened. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. So don't tell me about words. I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who's also here tonight. And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.","10/9/16"
36,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","10/9/16"
37,"Raddatz","Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. ","10/9/16"
38,"Clinton","Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice. When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.","10/9/16"
39,"Audience","(APPLAUSE)","10/9/16"
40,"Clinton","And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. ","10/9/16"
41,"Clinton","He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion. He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."" He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words. ","10/9/16"
42,"Trump","Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama. I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And I'll tell you what. I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor. When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. ","10/9/16"
43,"Raddatz","Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.","10/9/16"
44,"CANDIDATES","(CROSSTALK)","10/9/16"
45,"Raddatz","I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.","10/9/16"

50,"Raddatz","And really, the audience needs to calm down here. ","10/9/16"
51,"Clinton","... I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people. So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country. ","10/9/16"
52,"Trump","Because you'd be in jail.","10/9/16"
53,"Raddatz","Secretary Clinton...","10/9/16"
54,"Cooper","We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You're just wasting time.","10/9/16"
55,"Raddatz","And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless."" The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don't call that extremely careless? ","10/9/16"
56,"Clinton","Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I'm not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that. But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands. I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands. ","10/9/16"
57,"Raddatz","OK, we're going to move on. ","10/9/16"
58,"Trump","And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document. Right? She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant. You know, it's amazing. I'm watching Hillary go over facts. And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don't think so. She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong. And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn't before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. ","10/9/16"
59,"Cooper","We have to move on.","10/9/16"

83,"Trump","I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails? I'd like to know. Why aren't you bringing... ","10/9/16"

86,"Cooper","Ken Karpowicz has a question.","10/9/16"
87,"Trump","It's nice to -- one on three.","10/9/16"
88,"QUESTION","Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better? ","10/9/16"
89,"Cooper","That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience. ","10/9/16"
90,"Clinton","If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald. ","10/9/16"
91,"Trump","No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.","10/9/16"
92,"Audience","(LAUGHTER)","10/9/16"
93,"Cooper","Secretary Clinton?","10/9/16"
94,"Clinton","Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we've got to get costs down. We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That's the highest we've ever been in our country. ","10/9/16"
95,"Cooper","Secretary Clinton, your time is up. ","10/9/16"
96,"Clinton","So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up. ","10/9/16"
97,"Cooper","Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. ","10/9/16"
98,"Trump","It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care. It's only getting worse. In '17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It's very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It's catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it. ","10/9/16"
99,"Cooper","Mr. Trump, your time... ","10/9/16"
100,"Trump","It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced. ","10/9/16"
101,"Cooper","Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, ""the craziest thing in the world,"" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth? ","10/9/16"
102,"Clinton","No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it's very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That's where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies... ","10/9/16"
103,"Cooper","Secretary Clinton...","10/9/16"
104,"Clinton","... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma... ","10/9/16"
105,"Cooper","Your time is up.","10/9/16"
106,"Clinton","... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it. So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That's not going to work. ","10/9/16"
107,"Cooper","Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. ","10/9/16"
108,"Trump","Well, I just want -- just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster. ","10/9/16"
109,"Cooper","You've said you want to end Obamacare...","10/9/16"
110,"Trump","By the way...","10/9/16"
111,"Cooper","You've said you want to end Obamacare. You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?","10/9/16"
112,"Trump","We're going to be able to. You're going to have plans...","10/9/16"
113,"Cooper","What does that mean?","10/9/16"
114,"Trump","Well, I'll tell you what it means. You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come... ","10/9/16"
115,"Cooper","Are you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?","10/9/16"
116,"Trump","President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work. But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected. And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We're going to block grant into the states. We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states... ","10/9/16"
117,"Cooper","Thank you, Mr. Trump. ","10/9/16"
118,"Trump","... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.","10/9/16"
119,"Cooper","Thank you, Mr. Trump. ","10/9/16"
120,"Raddatz","We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.","10/9/16"
121,"QUESTION","Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them. You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over? ","10/9/16"
122,"Raddatz","Mr. Trump, you're first. ","10/9/16"
123,"Trump","Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They'll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. And, you know, there's always a reason for everything. If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists. And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."" Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name. But the name is there. It's radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name. ","10/9/16"
124,"Raddatz","Secretary Clinton?","10/9/16"
125,"Clinton","Well, thank you for asking your question. And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. I want to say just a couple of things. First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we've had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali. ","10/9/16"
126,"Clinton","My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That's what America is. That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren. It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see. It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else. ","10/9/16"
127,"Raddatz","Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. ""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice."" Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test? ","10/9/16"
128,"Trump","First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today. The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me. Excuse me.. ","10/9/16"
129,"Raddatz","And why did it morph into that? No, did you -- no, answer the question. Do you still believe... ","10/9/16"
130,"Trump","Why don't you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.","10/9/16"
131,"Raddatz","I do.","10/9/16"
132,"Trump","Why don't you interrupt her?","10/9/16"
133,"Raddatz","Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?","10/9/16"
134,"Trump","It's called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country. ","10/9/16"
135,"Raddatz","And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That's not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country? ","10/9/16"
136,"Clinton","Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those? So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say. ","10/9/16"
137,"Trump","That's not been debunked.","10/9/16"
138,"Clinton","So, please... ","10/9/16"
139,"Trump","That has not been debunked.","10/9/16"
140,"Clinton","... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.","10/9/16"
141,"Trump","I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn't have. Well, I just want to say... ","10/9/16"
142,"Raddatz","There's been lots of fact-checking on that. I'd like to move on to an online question...","10/9/16"
143,"Trump","Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.","10/9/16"
144,"Raddatz","She did not.","10/9/16"
145,"Trump","Could I just respond to this, please? ","10/9/16"
146,"Raddatz","Very quickly, please. ","10/9/16"
147,"Trump","Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them. In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don't want them. And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country. Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country. They're murderers and some very bad people. And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen. We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn't be allowed to happen. ICE just endorsed me. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn't. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It's a horrible thing she's doing. She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you. ","10/9/16"
148,"Raddatz","Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes. ","10/9/16"
149,"Clinton","Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."" It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic. And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership. But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected. They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. ","10/9/16"
150,"Clinton","Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has... ","10/9/16"
151,"Raddatz","We're going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you're out of time. ","10/9/16"
152,"Clinton","... with the Russians and other foreign powers.","10/9/16"
153,"Raddatz","Mr. Trump?","10/9/16"
154,"Trump","Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous. Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That's one that I haven't... ","10/9/16"
155,"Audience","(LAUGHTER)","10/9/16"
156,"Trump","OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That's the good thing. That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That's a big, big difference. We're talking about some difference. But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don't know Putin. But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. They're actually quite great. ","10/9/16"
157,"Raddatz","Thank you, Mr. Trump. ","10/9/16"
158,"Cooper","We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?","10/9/16"
159,"QUESTION","Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes? ","10/9/16"
160,"Cooper","Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. ","10/9/16"
161,"Trump","Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She's a United States -- she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn't she change it? Why didn't you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But -- and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. ""I wish you would have done this."" But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We're getting rid of carried interest provisions. I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form. We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She's raising your taxes really high. And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There's no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. We're down at 1 percent. And that's, like, no growth. And we're going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody's taxes massively. ","10/9/16"
162,"Cooper","Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes? ","10/9/16"
163,"Clinton","Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true. I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do. But I'll tell you what he's going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, here's what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It's called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong. ","10/9/16"
